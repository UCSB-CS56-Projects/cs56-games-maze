Bugs that need fixin
- if the Highscores .ser file is empty, clicking view high scores breaks the App 
- The view of time completed on the high score table is not formatted properly

Ideas for improvement
- save games and load them from .ser files in app instead of on computer (may fix the load bug we currently have)
- develop a system for ranking maze difficulty so players can be ranked against eachother

- go back through our code, clean and comment it
